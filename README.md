Voxen - Your Personal AI Assistant 🚀

Voxen is an AI-powered virtual assistant built using Python. It can recognize voice commands, respond with speech, and perform various tasks like:

✅ Voice Recognition – Listens for the wake word “Voxen” and responds to commands.
✅ Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Uses pyttsx3 to convert text into natural-sounding speech.
✅ Web Navigation – Opens Google, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more.
✅ News Updates – Fetches real-time news headlines using NewsAPI.
✅ Music Playback – Plays requested songs from predefined links.

This project utilizes SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, webbrowser, requests, and Pygame for seamless interaction. More features like weather updates, automation, and smart AI responses can be added!
